# Merger

# [martinconnarty.github.io](https://martinconnarty.github.io)

Merger is designed to be a really simple way to help you build documents, such as helping with putting together markdown.


## Usage


In the template, put whatever you like in there. Where replacements are needed use

`#{fieldname}#` as the placeholders

Press enter, and each fieldname becomes a form option

Once ready, press submit again and the template will be populated.


## Roadmap/Ideas

I would like to find a way to read in a CSV clientside, and then act a lot like a mailmerge. Not sure how possible this is though.
