# Merger

# [martinconnarty.github.io](https://martinconnarty.github.io)

Merger is designed to be a really simple way to help you build documents, such as helping with putting together markdown.
## CSV Merge Usage

CSV Merge uses a CSV you upload in conjuction with a template you specify. If the fields in the template match up with the columns in the csv, then it will autopopulate the template with each row.
Results are stored and can be browsed with the next/preview buttons.

## Manual Merge Usage


In the template, put whatever you like in there. Where replacements are needed use

`#{fieldname}#` as the placeholders

Press enter, and each fieldname becomes a form option

Once ready, press submit again and the template will be populated.


## Roadmap/Ideas

I would like to find a way to read in a CSV clientside, and then act a lot like a mailmerge. Not sure how possible this is though.
