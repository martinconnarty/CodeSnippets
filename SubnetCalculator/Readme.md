# Subnet Calculator


This is a script I've produced after struggling to find a simple script to give me IP addresses.

See it in action with demo.html, but if using it you can call the function with:

To get an array of all the IP addresses:

```ipArray=getIPsFromCIDR(net,"addresses")```

To get a summary (network, broadcast):

```ipArray=getIPsFromCIDR(net,"highlights")```
